        <!--   <h3>This is my First Blog</h3> -->
         <p class="content">
            
            I read The Library of Babel,
             and my thoughts are that the point he was trying to make clear was that we as humans 
             treasure knowledge and the library is that place of knowledge,
             and we would do anything to protect that knowledge. One thing I grasped 
             was that Borges was trying to implicate that the Library contains knowledge,
             and we must treasure that knowledge like how librarians do.
             
                 The Garden of forking paths is simply put as stories existing simultaneously in an alternate universe, its like you choose which path to believe,
                 for example, in most role-playing games, you choose which path to take your character into,
                 you get choices into which direction you want to steer to, and the path you choose to take will determine where u end up.

                 The reading "As we may think" by Bush predicts the future of technology about how computers in the future will process information, how you can record memories,
                 before this has been implemented.
                 Technically he predicted the bible of babel in terms of technology, us having infinite information on a machine.
                 As I was spacing out in class today, what I was thinking about was how I want the layout of my website and the flow,
                 how I want it to flow. I want to keep it simple really, am not a complicated person and I wouldn't say I have a lot to 
                 talk about myself rather than to illustrate therefore I want to keep it simple with a nice flow.
                 
                 I did some research, and I found this book called,                
                 Don't Make Me Think: A Commonsense Approach to Web Usability By Steve Krug. The heading itself made me think a lot, I thought I was going to talk
                 about myself in my website till it clicked me, the best websites do not tell u anything, they convince you aesthetically, they convince your eyes,
                 so your eyes could convince your brain about something interesting. I looked around for websites till I found a website called mymind.com, it was
                 sort of what I was looking for but not exactly. The thing I do not like is how it has a lot of text and a lot of stuff; I only love the webpage 
                 and how the headers are kept neat and tight, and they are not clustered. In terms of home page, I want my first page to be similar to that one.
                 
                 I remember the lecturer 
                 saying that we must look for 3 websites and mention what we like and what we do not like about them including the Wits-Ulwazi page. The thing about the Ulwazi website is that it 
                 is student friendly, that's why the lecturer said she does not like it. Personally, speaking It was designed for a student based on how complicated it is, we usually skim through 
                 a website but then this one requires us to read through it. I don't like how complicated it is,
                 its like you open a certain page on the website and you still must read, it does not give us simple access to it.
                 
                 As for my goals for this course Interactive Media is something I have always had a keen interest in, therefore moving to these websites, I can't even hold my excitement.
                     In high school I did computer applications technology therefore we learned HTML and how to create basic websites, therefore I was really interested in it, 
                     and I had always wanted to further my studies in it through JS and CSS and now I am going to learn that. After I am well knowledgeable 
                     in Website creation I want to further my studies into Applications. I want to end up being able to turn my websites into Apps, And that is my goal.
                   
                     Setting Up GitHub was no hassle since I already had GitHub, I installed it the previous year during the Game Design Exam as I was collaborating with some class mates,
                     so it was used as sort of an alternative for sharing files, but we ended up
                     abandoning it because it was a bit complicated at first but now I understand it and how it works.

        <p class="content">World Wide Web, a web full of knowledge, where you can find information about anything.
             This book, the world wide web by Tim Berners-Lee, technically describes what a world wide web is. and what are the shortcuts. 
            The insides of the world wide web and how to navigate around it. It goes on to talk about the different parts of the world wide web which is the http.

             It continues to talk about the hyper textual marking language, in short HTML and what its used for. 
            This book's point is to make sure that after you have read it, you would surely know what a world wide web is.

           HTML is something I have always had interest in. since I had prior knowledge of it, watching the first practical lecture on it, 
            I wouldn't say was complicated. It's something I already understood, so it was more like I was refreshing my memory. So, as I was jogging my memory,
             I created a small website about lines whereby I just put a picture of lines and wrote a few stuff about it, so it was something like just reminding myself how to do it.
             Besides, compared to C#, HTML is still a baby, its easy. I don't know how this will change once we move to java, however that is a mystery I also will have to find out.

    <p class="content">Wow, this lecture was complicated yet fun, CSS fundamentals are sort of complicated but they are fun. I feel like with more time and practice I will be more familiar with them, and it will make life easier.
         There was a point whereby with the bars I had to draw my own, I didn't know that even with Interactive media I would have to like to draw my own menu bars because I did not understand how to get the menu bars from the website Andre showed us. However, it was fun.
          Even the fact that I went and added styling to my previous work that I had done the previous week, 
         which made it look more appealing, since HTML is basically just text and images, however the styling made it livelier. The one thing I love about coding is that when I code, and the work is hard, the moment I get it right, I get a sense of satisfaction that no other work could give me,
         it's like a feeling that says yes, you made it now. Because I know that once I do something once, the second time I do it, it will be easier because I have done it before and the third time, I will be cruising.

        Firstly, before I get into context with the theory lecture and the readings, I would like to talk about the video that says Bad doors are everywhere. Mostly what I can say about it, it's telling us that as designers', intent is important. 
        The way we intent to do something will get someone to behave and engage with it the way we intended them to. If you put a pull bar on a pushing door, its only evident that people are going to pull the door before they could push.
        What I got from this week's lecture is that we as designers are manipulators, therefore as manipulators we have to control the users with our designs. We have to put that BIG RED BUTTON and manipulate the users onto clicking on it.
         After clicking on that button, the users MUST get the results/feedback from clicking the button that will be satisfactory. It must be responsive and non-trivial.

        One thing I can say about the Mailloux reading about convention and context, is that conventions are usually controlled/ created by the context of users. What am trying to say is that for example when you create a website, have similar style to the trending styles, 
        users tend to accept conventions that are used or accepted by other users, and that influences how they use digital platforms. 
        If you come up with a new style no one is interested in, your website won't attract viewers.

            <p class="content">For my website development, I did a bit of JS, and well it's sort of complicated for now, but am getting the hang of it, Afterall practice makes perfect. 
                The fact that I can understand it means that am heading in the right direction.

                For my wireframes, I had this idea of creating a very free home page. I do not want a lot of stuff on it except for my name and a small overview but am just thinking of leaving my name there in big. Then I want to have only one button on the homepage which takes you to another page 
                where the webpage starts and you will see everything and choose where you want to go from there. Technically what I want to do is a cover page that takes you to a home page and I already wireframed that. I feel like it will be aesthetically pleasing also the 
                single button will communicate to the users that press me, since it will be in the middle and the only thing that is interactable, forcing the user to press it.

                After reading Design for the Real World: What is design. The question I have in mind is Who are my users for the Portfolio Website? Is it the lecturers who are going to mark my assignment, meaning I should follow the rubric strictly when designing my website? Or is it people out there, 
                Employers meaning I should showcase my skills with my website? That Is the main question am asking myself.
                This chapter for What is Design technically tells us about how the design was born. How design is everything and is everywhere. For example, everything you are looking at,
                most of it has been designed with intent except for nature
                My words for this week in terms of how UI and Interaction relate to each other is that: Interaction needs communication, and that communication is UI. if you can communicate well with the users, 
                then it will be easier for them to be able to interact with your website</p>

                    <p class="content">The goal is to make a website that I will be able to modify and complete in the near future, but I want easy navigation, not too complicated, I want to keep my navigation as simple as possible for the users to not get lost. I haven't done much
                        at this point, I have been working on my layout so far, an I had a bit of battle on whether I should use colours or use pictures for my website.
                        Also I don't think I will add media quarries and the navigation that pops up when you reduce your screen because it's a bit complicated, I followed andre's tutorial however there way a point whereby I struggled with it because of my page, it did not really fit,
                        so I think I will leave that our or just make it simple and not that overly special.

                        I feel like once I put on more of java elements in my website, the user experience will increase very highly. That is when I will implement the use of pictures, for now I feel like I should just keep it simple, for I am still a beginner.
                        Well looking at user experience for my website, all I can say is that, users will not have a tough time navigating on my website, for its overly simple and easy to use. The user's interaction with my website will not be so overly complicated.       
                        While working on my website, I realised that my wireframes were not really well thought out due to what our lecturer said in class, I wanted to make links, so what when you click on week one, it takes you to a week one blog, etc.
                           
                        I asked a lecture about a cover page, I wanted to include a cover page like other website I saw, imagine you open a website and there is only one button in the page and a video playing in the background with a name and the button says explore,
                        you click on it and you reach the homepage where the entire website is, I wanted to implement that cos I thought it would be aesthetically pleasing however,
                        one of the lecture said I must have a reason behind the cover page an I felt like my reason was not really valid, so I decided that I will remove it for i want to keep my website to keep it clean and simple.

                            <p class="content">I never published a website on Github before,
                                 I feel like the lecturers should have made us a video or at least shown us how to publish a website on github before, it was a struggle.
                                 I put my website on github however it did not provide me any links,
                                 I had to go make a research on Google as to what could’ve went wrong and luckily I found a video that showed me the steps I had to take to publish my website so it works when I click on the link.
        
                                 After reading the Graham et al reading, I realised that the reason most of the countries are underdeveloped is because of the lack of access towards the internet.
                                  I mean imagine if we had the same access to the internet in Africa as the US, wouldn’t our lives be easier. What this reading covers is the reasons so many people are left out in global networks.
                                   As an aspiring developer I am wondering if me becoming a developer will make an impact in the scale of things, in terms of Africa having more access to larger global networks. Since there is less content about countries in Africa,
                                  can we as aspiring developers change that? As an aspiring developer, that is a question I am willing to answer as the time goes.

                                          Lutz talked about how AI may be beneficial however if used for terrible means, it can discriminate. Since AI mainly comes from Algorithms that are based on chunks of data, in a part of that data,
                                           AI can be discriminative against certain people due to the data it was fed. Therefore, the data that is being fed to AI to develop its algorithm must be carefully analysed.
                                          Or else AI will benefit only those who are liked by the data provided and discriminate and be biased against those who are discriminated upon according to the data it was provided with. </p>

                                                After going through the (Kwet 2019) reading, this new type of colonialisation is called Digital colonialisation, whereby powerful foreign corporations use these advanced technologies to control us and shape our societies to how they want.
                                                 They want to control us and make us obedient through technological means.
                                                 They are these huge corporations that aim for the goodwill of the people of Africa while they have different agendas.  
                        
                                                 This paper continues to talk about how AI software can be programmed to be biased and act in interests of those who are in power and discriminate against people in Africa, with darker skin tones,
                                                  software such as facial recognition can be used as a tool for these foreign countries to control us and favour those who created this software’s through these systems. </p>

                                                    <p class="content">This week we went in depth more with Andre regarding JavaScript. 
                                                        It was fun as to we had exercises that we had worked on that wanted us to do some problem solving, 
                                                        it was finally the class experience that I had wanted, the interaction with the lecturer and other classmates allowed us to partake in the class activity making the lesson more engaging.
                                                         I had thought before that JS was more challenging, meanwhile its not really that bad, it just requires consistent learning and experimentations.
                                                         Now I will try to implement more JS in my website and see how that turns out.
