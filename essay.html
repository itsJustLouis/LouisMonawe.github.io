        <h2 class= "week" id="week1">Ethics, UI, UX, and Interaction Essay</h2>

        <p class="content">Takealot.com, a South African E-Commerce company, which can be referred to as the largest online retailer company in south Africa. This company is based in Cape town and was founded in 2011 by Kim Reid. This company itself had a major influence on the Online Shopping system in South Africa.

            I will be analysing this Company’s website, www.takealot.com. The company’s vision was to be the “Simplest, most customer centric online shopping in south Africa.” Takealot’s target market is anyone who can access the internet, and lives in south Africa, for it’s very simple and convenient to access and use. If there is anything you want and cannot find it at the local store, all you need to do is take any device that can access internet, log on to the Takealot website, which is fairly easy to understand, and order you product which will arrive in a few days.
            
            The reason I chose this website to analyse, its for the fact that so many south Africans, everyone I know, has used this website and that means they understood it, which makes me want to understand that what makes it distinct from other websites which are terribly difficult to understand. Therefore, I will analyse the UI, UX and the ethical consideration took when designing this website which make it so different. To analyse this website, I will mainly be referencing from the 2 books I have read and understood, which are “Don’t make me think by Steve Krug” and “What is Design by Papanek”.

            Now looking at the website www.takealot.com, their use of typography is simple and not very complicated. What I mean by that is, all the words are small and normal, using the Ariel font and are black in colour, meanwhile the prices of the products stand out more as they are bold and bigger in size. Imagine looking for a product’s price in a website and struggling to find it, that’s why I think they made it stand out more, so its easily accessible. To make the website more customer friendly, each brand has its own logo, in its colour and in big,
             so users who feel comfortable using a certain brand can find their brand easily. They used words in bold and big, which categorize the products for you according to your taste and past purchases. The text/information is limited about the product, until you click on the product then you can find information about the product.
             It’s clear, easy to read, following the principles of Good UI, with only one font across the entire website. Just as Krug said "Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left. In the end, you'll have a page with about 25 percent of the words you started with—and it will be twice as good." (Krug, 2014 page 85). Most of the words on the website were eliminated and replaced with images, making the website friendly and not daunting.
            
             The colour that has been used for the website is simple white, to compliment the text in black. Since the company’s colour is blue, there is a navigation bar with a blue colour on top of the page, but the rest of the page is white and greyish. I think the reason for the background colour was to make the black text stand out even more. the entire website is not completely white, they used light grey. Each product has a background of white in its own block, with the product,
             while the background of the white blocks, or the page in its entirety is grey, making the products stand out more by making them brighter.

            The website’s layout is very simple and straight forward. The website has a navigation bar at the top which also has a search bar. There is a difference from a pc screen to a smartphone screen size, most of the buttons on the navigation bar disappear and what becomes available are 3 bars, when you click on them, the buttons that were on the navigation bar become visible.

             Making a good use of Icons that make it easy to navigate. Under the navigation bar, there is the part that shows you deals which change every few seconds, followed by different brands, you can scroll left to right to see more. As you scroll down, the products are separated, each product is in its own block, making it simple to select each product. With spaces in between each product,
              making the website visually appealing. The products however are categorized, you can swipe them from left to right and see more product. Making it easier to see more products which are recommended to you specifically. once you click on a product, you are taken to another page, from there, you can see more details about the products and you can either add the product to your cart, or your favourites list.

            Navigation around this website is influenced by the font, buttons, colours, and layout. For example, once you hover over a product, there is interaction immediately, there is a faded grey over the product, showing you that you can click on it. That is accompanied by alternative text, once you hover over the product, text appears, showing the name of the product, and once you click, it takes you to another page which tells you all about the product. 
            In green, there is an option for adding the product to your cart, making the website quite user friendly. This is a good example of good UI, for it guides the customers to doing what they want to do on the app, and that is to order products.
           
            Steve Krug said "When we're creating Web pages, we're designing for people who are probably not sitting in a comfy chair, leafing through leisurely... And if we make them think about how to use our site, we're not meeting their needs" (Krug, 2014, page 2). Meaning that websites should be intuitive, and the user should be able to navigate without thinking about it. That principle was followed in this website. As Papanek once mentioned that a website should be designed with the user’s needs and preferences in mind.
             Therefore, this website brings forth the user’s needs which are to not spend much time looking for something but find it immediately by seeing its image and being able to click on it and order it immediately. (Papanek, 1984).
            
             The labelling on each button, and the use of images to replace the text on the website makes it easy for users to be able to find what they are mainly looking for. There is also immediate response from the website’s interactivity. for example, once you add a product to your cart, a button pops up which guides you to the cart. That is an example of the website providing clear and concise instructions to the user. This website also uses icons and text side by side. for example, if you look on the top of the website on the navigation,
             you will see an icon that represents a cart, with a number. Subconsciously you already know it’s telling you how many items are in your cart from the use of the icon, making it easier for users to recognise Icons rather than having to read everything on their own. That is an example of good user experience according to me. 
            
             With websites, Usability, Accessibility, and Accountability are very important, no one will explore a website they can’t use. Websites need to achieve their goals but more importantly they need to meet needs and expectations of their users. Therefore, ethical considerations must be considered when designing websites. Usability is an important factor in user experience. A website should be easy to navigate through while providing a good experience for its user. What I mean by that is, a website must be responsive and quick. It must also be straightforward, no one wants to use a website that is complicated.
             If a website doesn't not meet any of those standards, users will get unsatisfied, frustrated and that will influence them to never use your website, therefore impacting the business negatively. A Website is the pride of a company, therefore it must have a good UI and UX.
            
             The second factor, Accessibility states that a product must be used by anyone. What I mean is that users of all types, must be able to access your website without a hassle. The benefits are for the organization in charge of the website, therefore accessibility to users of all types will not only guarantee more user engagement, but it will also guarantee more products and services being sold.
            
             Accountability, a user must be able to feel safe when using a website. What I mean is that Privacy is a critical concern with websites. As a designer, you must make sure that your user’s personal data is safely protected and invisible, no one is supposed to access that data without permission from the user. A website must be secured, it must be protected from problems such as cyberattacks and hacking that would pose as a threat to the user’s personal data. Users must be made aware of how their data will be used. if a designer makes sure that all these demands are met, designers can be confident that their websites will be reliable to users. 
            
             Krug (2014) states that "Privacy is a big deal, and people are becoming more aware of it. Be respectful of your user’s privacy, and be transparent about your data collection and sharing practices." What Krug is emphasizing on is that, as designers we must be respectful towards users’ privacy. Users must trust your website since more and more people are becoming more cautious with sharing their personal information on certain websites they do not trust (Krug, 2014, p. 188).
            
             Papanek mentioned that Designers have responsibilities when it comes to creating safe websites for users. He said "Design has become the most powerful tool with which man shapes his tools and environments (and, by extension, society and himself). This fact gives designers a central role in determining the social and environmental impact of their work." Meaning that when a user designs a website, they must think of the negative consequences their designs may cause to different people, for example, you cannot indirectly insult someone with your design, therefore as designers we must think responsibly about our designs and how they may harm others. (Papanek, 1984)
           
             To show that designing an ethical yet responsible website is important, both (Papanek, 1984) and (Krug, 2014) realised how important it is to acknowledge ethics in UI and UX, mainly revolving around the idea of privacy, data, and society.
            
             The website by www.takealot.com is a website that is strong ethically, for it is a website that is used by the entire country. The website is fairly simple therefore adhering to the ethical principles of interaction. The website even has a review section, whereby different people around the country, who have already purchased the product express their concerns. From analysing this website, one thing that they made perfectly was to keep it as simple as possible. One thing I hate about the website is that there are the adverts which shows what is on sale, I feel like they should limit as to how many adverts they should put, for the website simple has too many adverts, on the side an on the top,
             I get the fact that the adverts help with production however they are frustrating. This website however prioritizes users and its easily accessible for anyone using any device with internet, that makes it a great example of UI and UX.

            <h2 class= "week" id="week1">Algorithmic Culture and AI on the Internet.</h2>
    
            <p class="content">
                If someone in the developments of AI did not sign the manifesto, does that simply mean that they are denying the risks AI poses? Are we that closer to the age whereby AI Human Robots come to life and start taking over the world, making it the main reason why this manifesto has so many Bigwig’s signatures?
                These recent advancements of Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic culture expansion have left a huge impact throughout the internet and the world-wide web, changing the way we interact with these online spaces. Meanwhile many researchers and experts are still on the topic of “potential risks that are associated with Artificial Intelligence development and its impact on humanity”. It is easy to point out that limiting the risks of AI should be a priority. For us to strive, we have to harness the power of AI whilst safeguarding humanity, or just stop in the development of AI however, it brings many opportunities and progress.
                While reading an article called “Digital Inequalities in the age of Artificial intelligence” (Lutz 2019, p141-148). Lutz mentioned that Algorithmic culture and AI are very beneficial to humanity, however, if they were to be placed in the wrong hands, it could worsen the current state of existing digital inequalities!
                Algorithmic culture mainly ranges from various search engine results to social media feeds and personalized internet recommendations, they manage the information and content we put, access, and consume all across the World-wide web/internet. Just like AI, they have their own ability to learn, adapt and make decisions based on what they have learnt to increase our overall internet experience. Many can be looking at the beneficial side of algorithmic culture and be too blindsided to see the dark side. They would ask, ‘’But HOW could AI worsen the state of digital inequalities?’’ 
                According to (Lutz 2019) Artificial Intelligence relies on the vast amounts of data that comes from various online platforms and services and that could lead to many biases and discriminatory results. As Noble stated, “The algorithmic systems that construct our digital environments reproduce existing social, economic, and cultural inequalities” (Noble, 2018). This gives a more even solid reason why we should address these biases to ensure safety and fairness within the Online environment. For example, biased algorithms may start presenting certain groups with limited opportunities or enforce existing prejudices amongst them. These biases can easily grow around areas that are used mainly for access to information, and job opportunities.
                With providing people access to information, Algorithms play a huge crucial role in determining what information to expose online to a certain individual. Search engine algorithms prioritize certain websites and contend all because of various factors such as popularity, and user preferences. Therefore, this can easily turn into something huge such as when these algorithms unwarily increase the existing biases and reduce the visibility of content from underrepresented communities. Resulting in a small rage of information available to individuals therefore enforcing the existing inequalities and giving them more power with access to knowledge and other groups no access to certain knowledge.
                Regarding Job opportunities, AI is starting to get used in recruitment processes whereby algorithms select and filter candidates and places them for best suitable for a certain job position. Even though this saves a lot of time for the recruitment process. These algorithms may recycle and use past bias hiring data and lead to discriminatory selections, leading to an unequal and unfair number of applicants from a certain group being hired. Since the algorithm may learn to favour people from that certain group, leading to limited employment for people in certain groups. Just as Virginia Eubanks in her book titled “Automating Inequality” mentioned “automated decision-making systems encode existing structural biases, replicate and deepen existing inequalities, and disproportionately target and harm poor and marginalized communities” (Eubanks, 2018).
                To address these digital inequalities, ethical frameworks for algorithmic culture and AI should prioritize factors such as fairness, inclusivity, and honesty. Meaning that the development of algorithms may continue however they must strictly be developed so that they are aware of these biases and be able to mitigate them. These algorithms before they could be used for major work, they should be evaluated regularly for to detect and rectify discriminatory results. Collaboration amongst technologists, social scientists, ethicists, and professors, should help develop a guideline and practices that could promote fairness in algorithmic decision making. This was a solution mentioned by an Associate professor of African American studies in Princeton University, that “Auditing algorithms for bias and discrimination should be as central to our practices as code review” (Benjamin 2019). Because by addressing these ethical concerns, we can proceed to build an online world through algorithmic culture and AI in a way that prioritizes the safety of all people and creates a trustful and more suitable internet ecosystem.
